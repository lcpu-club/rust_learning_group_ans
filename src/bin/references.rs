/// ### References
/// 
/// If you came from C++, you might have heard of references. However, the
/// concept of references in Rust is *very different* from C++. In C++, a 
/// reference is somewhat *an alias* to the variable. Notice that in the 
/// following C++ code, when you pass `a` to a reference `b`, `b` will become
///  an alias to it. You can use `b` as if it's of type `T` , without having
///  to write `b->push_back`.
///
/// ```c++
/// std::vector<int> a{1, 2, 3};
/// std::vector<int> &b = a; // A C++ reference to a variable
/// b.push_back(4); // You can use C++ reference type `T&` just like `T`
/// ```
///
/// Under the hood, C++ references are pointers, but they are used like normal
/// variables, that's why they are treated as aliases.
///
/// References in Rust are different. You may call them *safe pointers*. 
/// Use **borrow operator** `&` (the address-of operator in C) to get a reference.
///
/// ```
/// let x: usize = 1;
/// let y: &usize = &x; // You cannot write `x` here!
/// ```
///
/// References to `T` are of their own type `&T`, just like C++ pointers.
///
/// ```
/// fn ref_is_a_type(x: &usize) { /* ... */ }
/// 
/// let x = 114514;
/// ref_is_a_type(&a); // OK
/// ref_is_a_type(a);  // ! Compiler Error: Mismatched type!
/// ```
/// 
/// The `&mut` operator will give you a mutable reference, which allows
/// you to modify the address it points to through it. The mutable
/// reference `&mut T` is like the normal C pointer, while the immutable
/// reference `&T` (also called shared reference) is like the pointer
/// version of C++ `const T&`.
///
/// Deref operator `*` is `&`'s counterpart.
///
/// ### Borrowing
///
/// Instead of 'getting address of', Rust uses 'borrowing' to describe
/// the `&`. A reference doesn't take away the original value's ownership,
/// but uses it temporarily, and guarantees a 'return' after use. 
///
/// ```
/// let owner = String::from("Hello, world!");
/// let reference = &owner;
/// drop(*reference); // ! Compiler Error: Cannot move out of reference
/// ```
/// 
/// Rust compiler also enforces a reader-writer lock rule on reference
/// (with no runtime cost). Within any scope, you can either
///
/// 1. Have *any number of* immutable references.
/// 2. Have *only one* mutable reference.
///
/// You may wonder why we need to prevent data races if we are not
/// concerned about concurrent programming. Consider the following
/// situation. If you push an element to the back of a `Vec` through
/// a mutable reference `a`, but there's an immutable reference `b`
/// pointing to the first element at the same time. What would you get
/// when you read from `b`, if the `Vec` grows and moved to a new place?
/// 
/// As a *safe* pointer, references are guaranteed to be valid, if you
/// are not playing with `unsafe` stuff. You won't access illegal memory
/// when using it. The tradeoff is that you have to follow some rules.
/// Besides the borrowing rules, Rust also have lifetime rules to ensure
/// this. We'll (definitely) look into lifetimes later.
///
/// ### Quiz
///
/// Fix the code below to make it compile and pass the tests. Use shadowing and
/// mutability.
///
/// ```no_run
/// fn main() {
///     let vec: Vec<_> = vec!["Rust", "is", "the", "Genshin", "Impact", "of", "programming", "languages", "but", "if", "you", "learn", "it", "well", "it", "feels", "like", "Saizeriya"].into_iter().map(String::from).collect();
/// 
///     fn this_is_t(t: String) -> String { t }
///     fn this_is_ref(r: &String) -> &String { r }
///     fn this_is_mut_ref(r: &mut String) -> &mut String { r }
/// 
///     /*
///         Guide: Fix the code below to make it compile.
/// 
///         DO NOT REORDER any line in the following code.
/// 
///         Fix errors in the following order:
///         1. Check the function signatures and fix function and macro calls. Add `mut`, `&`, `&mut` where necessary. Do not change the `in vec` part. 
///         2. Solve compiler error E0382. The compiler will suggest something for you. Consider ownership rules and reason why the solution works.
///         3. Solve compiler error E0502 by commenting out one line of the `assert_eq!`. Consider borrowing rules and reason why commenting out that line works.
